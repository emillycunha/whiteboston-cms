# **CMS WhiteBoston**

CMS WhiteBoston is a lightweight, open-source Content Management System (CMS) built specifically to empower Astro sites. Designed with scalability and simplicity in mind, CMS WhiteBoston integrates seamlessly with modern platforms, ensuring lightning-fast performance, low cost, and full-stack capabilities.

Whether you're building static or dynamic Astro sites, CMS WhiteBoston offers an easy-to-use and flexible backend for managing your content while scaling globally.

This is in the early stages and still in development. My first Vue project and it's open source. Feedback is welcome!
