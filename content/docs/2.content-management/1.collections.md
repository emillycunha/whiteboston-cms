# **Collections**

Collections are the backbone of CMS WhiteBoston, allowing you to organize and manage groups of related content. They provide a structured way to store, retrieve, and manipulate data for different types of content, such as blog posts, products, or events.

---

## **What Are Collections?**

A collection is a logical grouping of content items that share the same structure. For example, you can create a "Blog Posts" collection where each item has fields like `title`, `content`, and `published_date`.

Each collection is defined with specific fields that determine the attributes or properties of its content.

## **How Collections Work**

### **1. Define Collections**

Collections are defined within the CMS interface or database schema. You can create new collections and configure their settings based on your content requirements.

### **2. Add Fields**

Fields define the structure of your collection. For example, a "Blog Posts" collection might have the following fields:

| Field Name       | Type      | Description                   |
| ---------------- | --------- | ----------------------------- |
| `title`          | Text      | The title of the blog post.   |
| `content`        | Rich Text | The body content of the post. |
| `published_date` | Date      | When the post was published.  |
| `is_featured`    | Boolean   | Marks the post as featured.   |

### **3. Manage Content**

Once a collection is defined, you can add, edit, and delete content items within that collection. The CMS provides a user-friendly interface for managing your content.

## **Key Features of Collections**

### **Scalable and Flexible**

Collections are designed to handle both simple and complex content structures. You can create as many collections as needed, each with its own unique fields and settings.

### **Customizable Fields**

Define fields with different data types, such as:

- **Text**: For single-line inputs (e.g., titles).
- **Rich Text**: For formatted text content.
- **Date**: For dates and scheduling.
- **Boolean**: For true/false values.
- **Media**: For images, videos, or file uploads.

## **Example Use Cases**

### **1. Blog Posts**

- **Fields**: `title`, `content`, `published_date`, `is_featured`
- **Purpose**: Manage a list of blog articles.

### **2. Product Catalog**

- **Fields**: `name`, `description`, `price`, `image`
- **Purpose**: Display products in an online store.

### **3. Event Calendar**

- **Fields**: `event_name`, `date`, `location`, `description`
- **Purpose**: Showcase upcoming events.

## **Best Practices**

1. **Plan Ahead**: Before creating collections, outline the structure and fields needed for your content.
2. **Use Consistent Naming**: Use clear and consistent names for collections and fields to avoid confusion.
3. **Optimize Fields**: Only include necessary fields to keep collections lightweight and easy to manage.
4. **Test Relationships**: Ensure linked collections work as expected by testing data queries and permissions.
