# **Fields**

Fields define the structure of a collection in CMS WhiteBoston. They determine the attributes or properties of each content item, such as a blog postâ€™s title, content, or published date. By configuring fields, you can create custom content models that suit your specific needs.

---

## **What Are Fields?**

Fields are individual units of data that make up a collection. For example, a "Blog Posts" collection might have fields like `title`, `content`, and `published_date`. Each field has a specific type that defines the kind of data it can hold.

## **Types of Fields**

CMS WhiteBoston supports a variety of field types to handle different kinds of data:

| Field Type    | Description                              | Example                |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Text**      | Single-line text input                   | Blog post title        |
| **Rich Text** | WYSIWYG editor for formatted content     | Blog content           |
| **Date**      | Date picker for scheduling or timestamps | Published date         |
| **Boolean**   | Checkbox for true/false values           | Featured post (Yes/No) |
| **Media**     | Uploads for images, videos, or files     | Blog cover image       |
| **Number**    | Numeric input for prices or quantities   | Product price          |
| **Relation**  | Links content between collections        | Blog post categories   |

## **How to Add Fields**

### **1. Open the Collection**

Navigate to the collection you want to modify (e.g., "Blog Posts").

### **2. Add a New Field**

1. Click **"Add Field"**.
2. Define the following properties:
   - **Field Name**: A descriptive name (e.g., "Title").
   - **Field Type**: Choose the appropriate type (e.g., Text, Rich Text).
   - **Required**: Specify whether the field is mandatory.
   - **Position**: Specify the order in which the field appears within the collection.

### **3. Save the Field**

Once configured, click **"Save"** to add the field to the collection.

## **Customizing Fields**

### **Field Settings**

Each field can be customized to meet specific requirements:

- **Validation**: Define rules to ensure data integrity (e.g., minimum length, required values).
- **Default Values**: Pre-fill fields with default content to streamline data entry.
- **Placeholders**: Add instructional text to guide users (e.g., "Enter a title here").

### **Relational Fields**

Relational fields link content between collections. For example:

- A "Blog Posts" collection can reference a "Categories" collection.
- This enables dynamic relationships, such as assigning categories to blog posts.

---

## **Best Practices**

1. **Plan Field Structures**:

   - Identify the key attributes your content needs before creating fields.

2. **Use Descriptive Names**:

   - Ensure field names clearly indicate their purpose (e.g., "Product Price" instead of "Price").

3. **Minimize Required Fields**:

   - Only make fields required if they are essential to the content.

4. **Test Relational Fields**:
   - Verify that linked collections work as expected.

## **Example: Blog Post Fields**

Hereâ€™s a typical field setup for a "Blog Posts" collection:

| Field Name       | Type      | Required | Default Value |
| ---------------- | --------- | -------- | ------------- |
| `title`          | Text      | Yes      |               |
| `content`        | Rich Text | Yes      |               |
| `published_date` | Date      | No       | Current Date  |
| `is_featured`    | Boolean   | No       | false         |
| `cover_image`    | Media     | No       |               |
