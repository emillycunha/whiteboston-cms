# **Database**

CMS WhiteBoston uses **Supabase** to store and manage all CMS content data. This guide explains how to set up the database, enable security, and apply best practices.

---

## **How to Set Up the Database**

### **Create Tables**

To initialize the database, follow these steps:

1. Open the `schema.sql` file included in the repository.
2. Copy the SQL commands from the file.
3. Paste and execute the commands in the **SQL editor** of your Supabase project.

This script creates the following essential tables:

| Table Name             | Purpose                                          |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `users`                | Stores user account information.                 |
| `collections`          | Manages content collections like blogs or pages. |
| `fields`               | Defines fields (attributes) for collections.     |
| `content`              | Stores the actual content for collections.       |
| `organizations`        | Groups teams or users into organizations.        |
| `organization_members` | Tracks user memberships in organizations.        |
| `tickets`              | Tracks support tickets or similar entities.      |

### **Enable Row-Level Security (RLS)**

To protect your data, enable **Row-Level Security (RLS)** for restricted tables:

```sql
ALTER TABLE collections ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE users ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

---

### **Apply Security Policies**

Implement RLS policies to define who can access what data. Below are some example policies.

#### **Policy for Organization Access**

Allow users to access rows based on their organization membership:

```sql
-- Policy for collections table
CREATE POLICY "Allow access to organization collections"
ON collections
FOR SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
USING (organization_id IN (
  SELECT organization_members.organization_id
  FROM organization_members
  WHERE organization_members.user_id = auth.uid()
));

-- Enable RLS for the collections table
ALTER TABLE collections ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

#### **Policy for User-Specific Access**

Restrict access to rows that belong to the authenticated user:

```sql
-- Policy for users table
CREATE POLICY "Allow access to own user data"
ON users
FOR SELECT, UPDATE
USING (id = auth.uid());

-- Enable RLS for the users table
ALTER TABLE users ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

---

## **Testing the Database**

Once your policies are in place, test the database to ensure the following:

- Users can only see or modify data tied to their `organization_id` or `user_id`.
- Unauthorized access attempts are blocked.

For example:

- Log in as a test user and verify they can only see data related to their organization.
- Attempt unauthorized actions and confirm they are denied.

---

## **Best Practices**

1. **Keep Your Schema Organized**:

   - Regularly review and optimize table structures.

2. **Audit RLS Policies**:

   - Periodically review and test your policies to ensure they meet security requirements.

3. **Use Supabase Logs**:
   - Monitor Supabase's logs to track queries and debug issues.

With these steps, your database is now set up to securely manage content and user data for CMS WhiteBoston.
