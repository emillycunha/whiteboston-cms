# **Content**

Content refers to the actual data stored and managed within collections in CMS WhiteBoston. Whether itâ€™s blog posts, products, or events, content forms the dynamic part of your site, allowing you to present and update information seamlessly.

---

## **What Is Content?**

Content represents individual items or entries within a collection. Each content item inherits the structure defined by the fields of its parent collection. For example, in a "Blog Posts" collection, each blog post is a content item with attributes like `title`, `content`, and `published_date`.

---

## **How Content Works**

### **1. Create Content**

Content is created by populating the fields defined in a collection. For example:

1. Navigate to the desired collection (e.g., "Blog Posts").
2. Click **"Add New"** to create a new content item.
3. Fill in the fields with the required data (e.g., Title, Content, Published Date).
4. Save the content item.

### **2. Edit Content**

To update existing content:

1. Select the content item you wish to edit from the collection list.
2. Modify the fields as needed.
3. Save your changes.

### **3. Delete Content**

To remove content:

1. Navigate to the content item in the collection.
2. Click **"Delete"** and confirm the action.

## **Features of Content Management**

### **1. Dynamic Updates**

Content changes are reflected immediately across your site, enabling real-time updates for users.

### **2. Relationships Between Content**

Content can reference other collections using relational fields. For example:

- A blog post can reference categories or tags.
- A product can reference reviews or related products.

### **3. Draft and Published States**

Use states to control visibility:

- **Draft**: Content is saved but not publicly visible.
- **Published**: Content is live and accessible to users.

## **Example: Blog Post Content**

Hereâ€™s an example of a content item in the "Blog Posts" collection:

| Field Name       | Value                               |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `title`          | "How to Use CMS WhiteBoston"        |
| `content`        | "CMS WhiteBoston makes managing..." |
| `published_date` | "2025-01-12"                        |
| `is_featured`    | true                                |
| `cover_image`    | `/images/blog-cover.jpg`            |

## **Best Practices for Content**

1. **Plan Ahead**:

   - Define the structure of your collections before adding content.

2. **Use Consistent Formatting**:

   - Ensure uniform formatting for similar content types (e.g., dates, titles).

3. **Leverage Relationships**:

   - Use relational fields to link content dynamically, such as categories or authors.

4. **Test Drafts Before Publishing**:

   - Verify that draft content appears as expected before publishing.

5. **Backup Content**:
   - Regularly export content data or enable versioning to avoid data loss.
